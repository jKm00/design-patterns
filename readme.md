# Design Patterns

A repository where I implement design patterns as I read and learn about them.

## Structure

The repository is a single maven project. Design patterns are often devided into `Creational Patterns`, `Structual Patterns`, and `Behavioral Patterns`. That's why this project is also structured with a package for each of these categories. Inside, are packages for each design pattern related to the category. A design patterns has classes neccessary to implement the pattern as well as a service class which exposes a static `runExample()` method that executes an example where the pattern is used. This method can be called from the main method of the application to view the result of the respective pattern in the terminal.
